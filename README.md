# That's Life
<b>That's Life</b> is a variant of <b>The Game of Life</b>, a board game originally created by Milton Bradley in 1860 and redesigned a century later by Reuben Klamer. As the name suggests, it mirrors actual events from a person's life â€” from going to college and landing a job, through getting married and buying a house, to borrowing loans and finally retiring. The most distinguishing feature of the game is the presence of branching points where a player has to make a decision: take the normal route or explore a more roundabout path towards the goal of retiring with the most amount of cash on hand.
