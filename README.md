# That's Life
<b>That's Life</b> is a variant of <b>The Game of Life</b>, a board game originally created by Milton Bradley in 1860 and redesigned a century later by Reuben Klamer. As the name suggests, it mirrors actual events from a person's life â€” from going to college and landing a job, through getting married and buying a house, to borrowing loans and finally retiring. The most distinguishing feature of the game is the presence of branching points where a player has to make a decision: take the normal route or explore a more roundabout path towards the goal of retiring with the most amount of cash on hand.

## Task
<b>That's Life</b> is the major course output for an object-oriented programming class. The complete project specifications are given in the file [<code>Project Specifications.pdf</code>](https://github.com/memgonzales/thats-life/blob/master/Project%20Specifications.pdf), authored by Ms. Shirley B. Chu of the College of Computer Studies of De La Salle University. Below are screenshots of the gameplay: <br/>

## Built Using
This project was built using <b>Java</b> following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The graphical user interface was created using <b>Swing</b>, a platform-independent toolkit that is part of the Java Foundation Classes.

## Compilation and Running
The <code>.class</code> files were generated using <b>Java SE Development Kit 14</b>. To compile the Java files, execute the following command in the terminal (opened from the root directory, i.e., the directory containing [<code>source.txt</code>](https://github.com/memgonzales/thats-life/blob/master/source.txt)):

<code>javac -d out @source.txt</code>

To run the game, execute the following command in the terminal (opened from the root directory as well):

<code>java -cp .;bin;\*\*/\*.class ThatsLife</code>
