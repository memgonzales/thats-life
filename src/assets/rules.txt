That's Life! mirrors life events of people from going to college, having a career, raising a family, investing, buying a house, working, and retiring.

The goal of this game is for the players to reach retirement as early as possible with the most savings on hand.

Players decide what kind of life they want to experience during the game. At the start of each round, the player spins the wheel for a randomly generated number. This determines the number of spaces they will advance on the board.

Unlike usual board games, where there is only one path from start to end, That's Life!, at some areas along the way, presents players with two options: to continue moving forward, or to take a shorter (or maybe longer) route to reach another space on the board.

INITIAL INSTRUCTIONS

1. At the start of their turn, a player can either BORROW or PAY LOANS.
2. After settling loans, a player presses SPIN to get their number of moves.
3. After moving, a player presses GO to execute the effect of the space.
4. The current player can press the CARDS button to see their held cards.

GETTING STARTED

The game can be played by 2 or 3 players. Each player is given an initial cash of $200000. Each decides either to start a Career, or to start College. Afterwards, players take turns in spinning for a random number to determine the number of spaces they advance on the board.

If a player chooses to start a career, they take the Career Path on the board. They draw one Career Card and one Salary Card. If the career requires a degree, they return the card and take the next one. The final drawn cards are kept and will be the player's current career and salary.

If a player chooses to start college, they take the College Path on the board. They borrow $40,000 from the bank to pay for college, but will have the advantage of being able to take careers that require a degree; such careers also have more opportunities for pay raises. 

LIFE PATHS

Apart from the Career and College Paths at the beginning of the game, there are two more junctions:

At the first junction, the player can choose to take the Change Career Path, where they can draw one more Career and Salary Card and choose to switch to the new career. 

At the second junction, the player can choose to take the Start a Family Path, where they can get married (if they have not been already), buy a house, and have either a baby or twins. 

COLORED SPACES

All spaces on the board fall under one of four colors:

When a player lands on an orange space, they draw an action card from the deck and execute its effect.

When a player lands on a blue space, they draw a blue card from the deck and execute its effect, either collecting money from the bank or paying the bank or another player.

When a player lands on a green space, they either collect their current salary from the bank or have their salary and tax due increased according to their drawn Salary Card.

When a player reaches a magenta space, they stop and execute the effect of the magenta space. These include major milestones, such as graduation, marriage, and choosing a life path. Afterwards, the player spins for a number and moves again. 

BANK LOANS

Players borrow money from the bank when they do not have enough cash on hand. Loans can be borrowed in multiples of $20000. Each bank loan shall be paid with $5000 interest. Players may pay loans before the start of their turn, where each payment is a multiple of $25000. 

RETIREMENT

The game ends when all players reach the Retirement space. When a player reaches Retirement, their assets and loans are converted and settled through the following steps:

1. Collect retirement pay from the Bank. The first player to reach retirement collects $100000; second player collects $50000; and third player collects $20000.
2. Collect $10000 for each child they have from the bank.
3. Sell their house to the Bank for the selling amount listed on the card.
4. Repay to the Bank all outstanding loans with interest.
